<div id = "title"><h1>Security Vulnerabilities of stark-bayou-4626.herokuapp.com (Raewyn Duvall)</h1> </div>

<div id = "section"> Introduction </div>
<p>The web app we made in heroku for the 2048 game was riddled with security flaws that definitely need
addressing. I have found that it is quite easy to manipulate webpages, like the example we have here from
Raewyn Duvall, in order to perform malicious functions or crash the app. Below are my observations and 
recommendations on how to improve this website. </p>

<div id = "section"> Methodology </div>
<p>It was rather easy to test the vulnerabilities of the web application. Simply using the "curl" command 
allowed me to enter in my own data, injecting code and testing out other vulnerabilites. Other tests
were done online, seeing if the URI would respond by changing the query. In Raewyn's case, this was 
not an issue, but could be for others. </p> 

<div id = "section"> Abstract of Findings </div>
<p>It was not difficult to find some basic security vulnerabilities in Raewyn's app. The top three 
security vulnerabilities were easy to find and are listed below: <br/>
-The web app does not evaluate incoming input, so any user can potentially inject code directly
into the database just by simply sending their own code to the app for entry into the database. I 
was able to do this myself, and my resulting code redirected the web app to a youtube video. While this
is harmless, others could use it to redirect to a malicious website or also collect data by farming
clicks. <br/>
-The way that Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing is set up, anyone can have access to the web app. This means
that anyone is able to give input, including potentially skewed data, excessive data, or malicious code as 
mentioned above. By limiting access (limiting CORS) to those with certain credentials, there is significantly 
less risk of attack.
-The database used (MongoLabs) allows a file size input of 16MB. While this seems small, it would be easy for 
someone to spam the database with multiple relatively-large files. This could crash the program easily for 
attackers and make a general mess for those not wanting to scour the database in search of the malicious data
each time.</p>

<div id = "section"> Issues </div>
<div id = "problem"> Code Injecting</div>
<p>-Issue found in post API, /submitscores. <br/>
-High Risk, easy to redirect page or inject malicious code <br/>
-It is very easy to inject code disguised as game data through the post API. The game requires that all
requested data be present, but does not have any checks if the data is sincere. Injecting code in as data allows 
anyone to change the page when it is loaded on the root directory (/). I changed the website to a Youtube video, as seen here: <br/> 

<div id = "img"><img src="injection.gif" width= "450" height= "300"  alt="O'Doyle Rules" />  <br/> </div> </p>

<p>-The fix for this is relatively easy. The app simply needs to check for correct input, and can do so by using the
Caja-HTML-Sanitizer (found at https://github.com/theSmaw/Caja-HTML-Sanitizer). By installing the sanitizer in the app, 
HTML special characters can easily be escaped, and tags can be sanitized, leaving harmful code injections as simple text. <br/>
<div id = "eg">EXAMPLE: </div> var sanitizer = require('sanitizer');<br/>
sanitizer.excape('fake data'); </p>

<div id = "problem"> Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</div>
<p>-Issue found in web app, all APIs. <br/>
-High Risk, allows anyone to access site and potentially inject code regardless of credentials. <br/>
-The current method of CORS in the web app makes it very easy for any person to input their data, malicious or 
otherwise. In a situation like with the 2048 game, this is not necessary, as the data should only be coming from the 
web page sending the score data. Without a list of acceptable files, input can come from anywhere - as demonstrated by
my input here, clearly NOT from the 2048 game. Below we can see that my attack has easily been entered into the database: <br/> 

<div id = "img"><img src="CORS.jpg" width= "450" height= "300"  alt="CORS attack" />  <br/> </div> </p>

<p>-Once again, this is a relatively simple fix. By including an "if" statement, we can eliminate sharing from other websites.
CORS will only be enabled for certain sites. This can be easily linked to a php file with all the limits put in place, so that 
updates are not required for individual pages as long as they are linked to the php page (which therefore updates all approved
sites). <br/>
<div id = "eg"> EXAMPLE (in php file): </div>
	if($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] == "MySafeURI”)
    {<br/>
      header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: MySafeURI');<br/>
    }
  
  </p>
