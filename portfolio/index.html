	Corey's portfolio work can be found here. The majority of this work was done in his 
	class at Tufts University titled "Web Programming," where modern web development skills 
	were practiced. Skills using APIs, databases (including MongoDb), as well as HTML and modern CSS are 
	all showcased here.

	2048, modified to keep track of high scores: <br/>
Found here: http://obscure-spire-3241.herokuapp.com/ <br/>

My version of the popular game 2048 keeps track of your high scores. When you lose the game, you simply enter in your name and it will return with a window displaying your previous high scores. This is done by communicating with a Mongo database (MongoLabs on Heroku), adding the new score to the database and parsing a URL of JSON information for a particular name. <br/>

If you would like to see the raw JSON information that is parsed, simply query the /scores.json URL with your "name" as the variable "username". Example: http://obscure-spire-3241.herokuapp.com/scores.json?username=Jake . <br/>

This game is originally a work of Gabriele Cirulli and belongs to him, my additions are solely to showcase my programming experience. <br/>

Food Tracker App:<br/>
Found here: http://food-tracker-team15.herokuapp.com/ <br/>

The final assignment for our web programming class was a group project designed to help college students with finances. Our project helps individuals keep track of their expenses on food by texting a phone number we purchased through the website Twilio, paying around 1 cent per text. The information was then parsed and displayed as graphs of weekly, monthly, and yearly spending. <br/>

Unfortunately, there is not much data available for this site, as it was only intended to showcase our concept. The data from last month is also quite skewed, due to one of my teammates adding in his college tuition as a "monthly expense" on graduation day. You can watch the data change, however, by texting our number (774-302-0100) with the purchase amount and location of the purchase. We have it set to parse in the following way: If you have purchased $25 at Jacob Wirth, you send the text as: ' 25 Jacob Wirth ' , without the quotation marks or italics. <br/>

The way our data is set up, we parse the dollar amount as integers, so the dollar amount has to be a whole number. This was a bug we had discovered after the project was complete, so if you would like to test it, please keep that in mind. The app is registered under the heroku account of a teammate, so unfortunately I cannot update this for the time being. Also interesting is our implementation of web security features, seen in the table of expenses. We have put in measures to stop code injection by 'escaping' our input data, as seen by the failed injection in our table. Our computer science professor was very impressed with our work, and we received an A+ on the project. <br/>
