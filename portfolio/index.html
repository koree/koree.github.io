	Corey's portfolio work can be found here. The majority of this work was done in his 
	class at Tufts University titled "Web Programming," where modern web development skills 
	were practiced. Skills using APIs, databases (including MongoDb), as well as HTML and modern CSS are 
	all showcased here.
